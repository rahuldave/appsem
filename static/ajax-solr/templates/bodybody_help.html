<h3> How to Use the AstroExplorer </h3>
<p>
	AstroExplorer aims to be your research portfolio application. It allows you to explore astronomical resources such as
	publications, observations (and their associated datasets), objects, catalogs, and proposals, and to explore the relationships
	between them. It then enables you to save these resources into tagged libraries which you can access later, and into collaborations,
	so that you can share your findings with your co-workers and collaborators.
</p>
<p>
	We expose these resources and their connections by curating and indexing them all at one place. This is the model
	used by google, where the data resides on your servers, but the index on theirs. We have currently indexed all Chandra Observations,
	observations from several missions from MAST, related articles, objects, and observing proposals (88K observations and 10K publications).
	This is part of our current focus
	on NASA missions, since they have already curated extensive bibliographies. If you own a data set with bibliographic links which you would
	like to see curated, please contact us at adsvao.astroexplorer@gmail.com.
</p>
<p>
	This is a prototype!  It has been created to showcase what kind of functionality can be delivered when these resources are brought 
	together and exposed to the user in a web-based environment.  It is meant to provide search and discovery capabilities which 
	are complementary to the position-based searches supported by the VAO portal.
</p>
<p>
	The personalization features which are supported are based on the ADS login system, so they require users to log into their ADS account.
	This enables one to save queries, resources (publications and observations), tag them, and optionally share them with a group of
	collaborators.
</p>
<h3>Script to understand using the application.</h3>
<br/>
<ol class="normal">
<li>
<p>The Home Page:</p>
<br/>
<img width="800" src="{{staticprefix}}/images/helpimgs/Home-1.jpg"/>
<br/>
<p>
When you first visit AstroExplorer, you see the home page with some information about the application, 
and a simple search area with the ability to textually search either publications or observations (1). You can
elect instead to explore Publications or Observations under the Explore heading, or on the black bar up top. Or you
could decide to login (2) by clicking the link on the upper right. Also note the feedback and help buttons. You are reading the help text.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logging In:</p>
<br/>
<img width="600" src="{{staticprefix}}/images/helpimgs/Home2-1-1.jpg"/>
<br/>
<p>
	When you log in you are presented with a page that shoes you the collaborations you created, have been invited to, or are a member of. You can create new collaborations using the "Add Collaboration" (1) Button or the Collaborations Menu (2). You can also invite people to your collaboration, decline invitations, delete collaborations, or accept invitations.
</p>
</li>

<li>
	<p>
Click on the publications page in the black upper bar, displaying publications and facets which can be used to filter these publications. Alternately you can make a textual search, say, on "blazars", from the home page. This will lead to a screen like so:
</p>
<br/>
	<img width="900" src="{{staticprefix}}/images/helpimgs/Publications-2-1-1.jpg"/>
<br/>
<p>
There are four type of facets available on the left (publications, objects, observations, proposals). In the screen shot we see keywords(1). We can see the current search in the upper left (2), and the number of results (146) on the top of the pagination of results (3). If we are logged in, we can save the search, or individual publications into our library (4). One can currently sort results in two ways (publication date or citations), ascending or descending (5).
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Note that if you click the (X) (6) next to in blazars into search box, you will get the exploratory list of all publications in our system. If you type 'blazars' into the search box (7) below, you will see  10 autocomplete as keywords, smaller than the 146 you found earlier. This is because textual search searches titles abstracts, keywords, etc, rather than just being restricted to a given facet. To reproduce that search from this page, type blazars into the search box (7) and hit escape to stop the autocompletion, before hitting the return key.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
See the top keywords, active people, most studied objects, targets. Play around with the various facets. Save some searches and publications.
</p> 
</li>

<li>
<p> Using the (X) button to get back to the state of the search at text:blazars, click in the left on B1101+384 object-name facet, which, by the looks of our Tag Cloud, is one of the most studied. Our tag cloud limits us to the 20 most occurent values for any facet.
In missions, click the chandra mission facet. Note that the publications which surface also have data from FUSE. In this way we can figure multi-mission publications. The left side of your application now looks the left side of the image below:
</p>
<img width="500" src="{{staticprefix}}/images/helpimgs/Publications2.jpg"/>
<img width="343" src="{{staticprefix}}/images/helpimgs/Publications3-1.jpg"/>
<p> Notice from the right side that the most frequent target is Mrk421. You will see different spellings of it.  SIMBAD’s canonical name for QSO B1101+384 is Mrk 421. This problem arises because missions usually take target names from their Guest Observers who dont use a consistent nomenclature. We are tackling the curation of these targets to the object names specified by the CDS, but the current prototype reflects the rather incomplete state of our efforts.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
Pivot on B1101+384 by clicking the [P] next to the (X) in the Current Selection area on the upper left, notice Schull as main author, and two different Sembachs' on proposals. This is a variant of the previous problem, but instead has to do with the names that are obtained from various proposals and papers, and the need for normalization of these names. This too is a problem that we are tackling.
</p>
</li>
<li>
[NOTE: instead of using an object we may want to instead select a target] Facet on mission “Chandra” which reduces the set of results to 27 papers, and continue in observations (317 results)
</li>
<li>
Show the pop-over under current selection showing all obsids
</li>
<li>
Select instrument HRC-S which narrows results to 47 observations; sort on exposure time, showing the deepest observations first
</li>
<li>
Go to Observations tab, type in and autocomplete QSO B1101+384...4361 entries..highly studied
</li>
<li>
choose stuff taken with IUE/SWP. See FOV, resolution, exposure time facets.  Look at Urry, C, Megan proposals, and see authors. Note now that these are not papers, but observations used in papers.
</li>
<li>
Clear results, and pose the question: what is the impact of one or more observations of a particular target?  Pick MAST/Jupiter, click on the “See Metrics” which will display metrics on the 34 papers related to it.
</li>
<li>
Showcase the use of metrics to evaluate impact of proposals.  Start from publications tab, select Chandra, scroll down to Proposal facets and select “Fabian” from the PI facet section.  This generates a list of 73 observations (147 publications).  Click on “Metrics” to get the aggregate metrics number for all of them.
</li>
<li>
Show “saved” and collaborations, highlight things that have been saved along the way.
</li>
</ol>
