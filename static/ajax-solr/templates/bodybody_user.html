<h3> How to Use the AstroExplorer </h3>
<p>
	AstroExplorer aims to be your research portfolio application. It allows you to explore astronomical resources such as
	publications, observations (and their associated datasets), objects, catalogs, and proposals, and to explore the relationships
	between them. It then enables you to save these resources into tagged libraries which you can access later, and into collaborations,
	so that you can share your findings with your co-workers and collaborators.
</p>
<p>
	We expose these resources and their connections by curating and indexing them all at one place. This is the model
	used by google, where the data resides on your servers, but the index on theirs. We have currently indexed all Chandra Observations,
	observations from several missions from MAST, related articles, objects, and observing proposals (88K observations and 10K publications).
	This is part of our current focus
	on NASA missions, since they have already curated extensive bibliographies. If you own a data set with bibliographic links which you would
	like to see curated, please contact us at adsvao.astroexplorer@gmail.com.
</p>
<p>
	This is a prototype!  It has been created to showcase what kind of functionality can be delivered when these resources are brought 
	together and exposed to the user in a web-based environment.  It is meant to provide search and discovery capabilities which 
	are complementary to the position-based searches supported by the VAO portal.
</p>
<p>
	The personalization features which are supported are based on the ADS login system, so they require users to log into their ADS account.
	This enables one to save queries, resources (publications and observations), tag them, and optionally share them with a group of
	collaborators.
